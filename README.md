# Spark Repository

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the project files.

### Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository, unzip the files, and navigate into the project directory:

   git clone https://github.com/6661647a77616e/Spark.git
   cd Spark
   unzip Spark.zip
    ```


After finishing using the files, zip the project files back, commit, and push the changes to the repository:
